        <p>Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
            With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
            Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
            A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
            Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
        <p>Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
            Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
            The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
            With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
            Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
            Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
            I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"</p>
