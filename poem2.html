        <p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
            How I wonder what you are!
            Up above the world so high,
            Like a diamond in the sky.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
        <p>When the blazing sun is gone,
            When he nothing shines upon,
            Then you show your little light,
            Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.            
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Then the trav'ller in the dark,
            Thanks you for your tiny spark,
            He could not see which way to go,
            If you did not twinkle so.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>In the dark blue sky you keep,
            And often thro' my curtains peep,
            For you never shut your eye,
            Till the sun is in the sky.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>'Tis your bright and tiny spark,
            Lights the trav'ller in the dark:
            Tho' I know not what you are,
            Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</p>
