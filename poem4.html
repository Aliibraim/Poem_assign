        <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud
            That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
            When all at once I saw a crowd,
            A host of golden daffodils;
            Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
            Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
        <p>Continuous as the stars that shine
            and twinkle on the Milky Way,
            They stretched in never-ending line
            along the margin of a bay:
            Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
            tossing their heads in sprightly dance.            
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>The waves beside them danced; but they
            Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
            A poet could not but be gay,
            in such a jocund company:
            I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
            what wealth the show to me had brought:
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>For oft, when on my couch I lie
            In vacant or in pensive mood,
            They flash upon that inward eye
            Which is the bliss of solitude;
            And then my heart with pleasure fills,
            And dances with the daffodils.</p>
