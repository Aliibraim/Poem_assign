        <p>Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
            In the forests of the night;
            What immortal hand or eye,
            Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
        <p>In what distant deeps or skies,
            Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
            On what wings dare he aspire?
            What the hand, dare sieze [sic] the fire?        
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>And what shoulder, & what art,
            Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
            And when thy heart began to beat,
            What dread hand? & what dread feet?            
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>What the hammer? what the chain,
            In what furnace was thy brain?
            What the anvil? what dread grasp,
            Dare its deadly terrors clasp!</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>When the stars threw down their spears
            And water'd heaven with their tears:
            Did he smile his work to see?
            Did he who made the Lamb make thee?</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Tyger Tyger burning bright,
            In the forests of the night:
            What immortal hand or eye,
            Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?</p>
